### Specific Noise Reduction Solutions for the Addresses within the MKAD and TiNAO

---

### 1. **Selskokhozyaystvennaya St., Building 38, Unit 2 (MKAD)**

- **Problem:** Located within a busy area with a mix of residential and commercial traffic.
- **Greening Plan:** Install vertical green walls on the building facade and plant dense rows of evergreen shrubs along the street. Green walls can reduce sound transmission by up to 5 decibels.
- **Noise-Cancelling Systems:** Place noise-cancelling infrastructure at intersections, particularly at pedestrian crossings, to combat low-frequency traffic noise. This system can be effective during rush hours.
- **Speed Limit Reduction:** Implement a speed limit of 40 km/h near residential units to minimize noise from speeding vehicles.

---

### 2. **Varshavskoe Highway, Building 65, Unit 1 (MKAD)**

- **Problem:** High traffic from the highway creates significant noise pollution.
- **Greening Plan:** Create a green belt along the edge of the highway with tall trees (up to 8 meters) to act as sound barriers.
- **Sound Barriers:** Install sound-absorbing barriers made of Durisol panels along the roadside, focusing on areas close to residential buildings.
- **Speed Regulation:** Implement a reduced speed zone of 50 km/h within 500 meters of residential areas and monitor compliance using speed cameras.

---

### 3. **Leninsky Prospekt, Building 25 (MKAD)**

- **Problem:** Leninsky Prospekt is a major road with continuous traffic contributing to constant noise pollution.
- **Greening Plan:** Implement rooftop gardens on residential buildings and a tree-planting campaign along the median strip to absorb sound.
- **Noise-Cancelling Technology:** Focus on installing noise-cancelling systems at the building front, especially targeting heavy-traffic hours from 7:00 AM to 9:00 AM.
- **Traffic Management:** Reroute large trucks and buses during peak hours to alleviate noise.

---

### 4. **Prospekt Mira, Building 68 (MKAD)**

- **Problem:** Significant traffic, particularly during rush hours.
- **Greening Plan:** Use dense vegetation along the sidewalks and street medians. Tall shrubs and trees will help reduce ambient noise levels.
- **Noise-Cancelling Barriers:** Install at pedestrian-heavy intersections, targeting key noise peaks during high-traffic hours.
- **Smart Traffic Management:** Implement a dynamic traffic management system that lowers the speed limit and redirects vehicles when noise exceeds acceptable limits.

---

### 5. **Charoitovaya St., Building 1, Unit 3 (TiNAO)**

- **Problem:** Located in a quieter, suburban zone but with increasing noise from expanding residential and commercial areas.
- **Greening Plan:** Plant low-maintenance native trees and bushes around residential buildings and public spaces. This would create a natural noise barrier.
- **Sound Barriers:** Install sound-absorbing barriers at key points near the entrance to the street where traffic buildup occurs.
- **Speed Regulation:** Reduce speed limits to 30 km/h in residential zones and create traffic calming measures such as speed bumps.

---

### 6. **Anna Akhmatova St., Building 6 (TiNAO)**

- **Problem:** Growing traffic due to urban development, especially near commercial areas.
- **Greening Plan:** Integrate small parks with sound-absorbing vegetation such as pines and firs in the space between commercial and residential zones.
- **Noise-Cancelling Technology:** Install small-scale noise-cancelling devices near residential units, particularly at the rear of the building, to address background traffic noise.
- **Speed Limit:** Reduce the speed limit to 40 km/h within 300 meters of residential buildings and monitor using cameras.

---

### 7. **Sosenki Village, Starye Sosenki St. (TiNAO)**

- **Problem:** Noise from regional traffic passing through the village.
- **Greening Plan:** Establish green belts of tall trees (10-15 meters) around the village perimeter to block external noise.
- **Noise Barriers:** Erect noise barriers near residential zones that directly face the main road.
- **Traffic Diversion:** Reroute heavy traffic during peak hours to roads farther away from residential areas.

---

### 8. **SNT "Stroitel", Checherskaya St. (TiNAO)**

- **Problem:** Traffic from nearby major roads affects the peace of this suburban area.
- **Greening Plan:** Create noise-reducing green spaces around community buildings and along the main road.
- **Noise-Cancelling Infrastructure:** Install small-scale noise-cancelling systems at strategic points near major intersections where noise peaks.
- **Speed Limit Enforcement:** Reduce the speed limit to 30 km/h within residential areas and set up monitoring systems for traffic violations.
