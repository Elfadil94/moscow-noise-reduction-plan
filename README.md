For the **Comprehensive Noise Reduction Plan** to be more specific and aligned with the designated territories, let's refine the strategy to focus on **Novy Arbat Street**, **Tverskaya Street**, and **Kutuzovsky Prospekt** as the primary areas of intervention.

### Revised Noise Reduction Plan for Specific Territories:

**1. Novy Arbat Street (Pilot Area)**

- **Problem**: Novy Arbat Street is known for its high traffic volume, dense construction, and elevated noise levels. It's a hotspot for traffic noise, particularly due to its central location and proximity to both residential and commercial buildings.
  
- **Solution**:
   - **Urban Greening**: Dense planting of evergreen trees and shrubs along the sidewalks and medians. Installation of vertical green walls on buildings.
     - **Expected Reduction**: Noise reduction by 3-5 decibels.
   - **Sound-Absorbing Materials**: Use of acoustic panels with noise-absorbing properties on buildings facing the street. Integrate these materials into new constructions and refurbishments.
     - **Example Material**: Durisol panels, which are lightweight and eco-friendly.
   - **Smart Traffic Management**: Implement smart traffic systems that reroute vehicles during peak hours. Encourage electric vehicle (EV) usage through dedicated lanes for EVs.
     - **Pilot Test**: Establish sensors that monitor traffic patterns and noise levels in real time.

**2. Tverskaya Street**

- **Problem**: One of Moscowâ€™s busiest thoroughfares, Tverskaya Street suffers from constant traffic, contributing to severe noise pollution for both pedestrians and residents.

- **Solution**:
   - **Noise-Cancelling Infrastructure**: Deploy low-frequency noise-cancellation technology in high-traffic areas along the street. These devices will counteract the low rumble of traffic noise, significantly reducing the decibel level.
     - **Pilot Area**: Focus on intersections where traffic buildup is frequent.
   - **Sound Barriers with Absorptive Materials**: Install sound barriers near pedestrian areas with sound-absorbing properties. These barriers will help minimize the direct impact of traffic noise.
     - **Example**: Use high-performance acoustic concrete for sidewalks and barriers.
   - **Urban Greening**: Transform public spaces like Ploshchad Revolyutsii into more densely vegetated zones to absorb ambient noise.

**3. Kutuzovsky Prospekt**

- **Problem**: Kutuzovsky Prospekt is a major artery with heavy truck traffic, contributing to continuous noise pollution, particularly affecting residential buildings.

- **Solution**:
   - **Noise-Cancelling Barriers**: Focus on installing large-scale noise-cancelling barriers along Kutuzovsky Prospekt, particularly where residential areas are adjacent to the roadway.
     - **Implementation**: Use active noise control (ANC) systems that use sensors and speakers to emit sound waves that neutralize traffic noise.
   - **Smart Traffic Management**: Create designated lanes for trucks and EVs to reduce noise. Implement speed restrictions to reduce noise generated by speeding vehicles.
   - **Urban Greening**: Establish a green belt alongside Kutuzovsky Prospekt, with tall, dense trees and shrubs to act as natural sound barriers. Prioritize native species known for their sound absorption capabilities.

   - **Total**: $24 million.

2. **Tverskaya Street**:
   - Noise-Cancelling Infrastructure: $30 million.
   - Sound Barriers: $12 million.
   - Urban Greening: $8 million.
   - **Total**: $50 million.

3. **Kutuzovsky Prospekt**:
   - Noise-Cancelling Barriers: $45 million.
   - Smart Traffic Systems: $8 million.
   - Urban Greening: $5 million.
   - **Total**: $58 million.

### Adjusted Roadmap:

**Phase 1 (2024-2025)**:
- **Novy Arbat Street**: Begin greening and install pilot sound-absorbing materials on select buildings. Launch smart traffic systems.
  
**Phase 2 (2025-2026)**:
- **Tverskaya Street**: Install noise-cancelling technology at key intersections and begin urban greening.
  
**Phase 3 (2026-2027)**:
- **Kutuzovsky Prospekt**: Complete installation of noise-cancelling barriers and full-scale deployment of smart traffic systems.
